# Vehicle Information App

## Description

This Flutter application allows users to enter a vehicle number and fetch details from an external API. It uses the `http` package for making network requests and displays the retrieved information in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Enter a vehicle number to retrieve details.
- Displays vehicle information or error messages.
- Handles loading states and API errors gracefully.

## Dependencies

```yaml
dependencies:
  http: ^0.13.0
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.6
```

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IndifferentEngineer/gadi_info.git
   cd gadi_info
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Update API Key:**

   Replace `"your api key"` in the code with your actual API key from RapidAPI. You can find it in your RapidAPI account.

   ```dart
   final headers = {
     'x-rapidapi-key': "your api key",
     'x-rapidapi-host': "rto-vehicle-information-verification-india.p.rapidapi.com",
     'Content-Type': "application/json"
   };
   ```

4. **Run the app:**

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Code Explanation

- **Main Function:**

  Starts the app and sets `VehicleNumberScreen` as the home widget.

- **VehicleNumberScreen Widget:**

  - Contains a `TextField` for inputting the vehicle number.
  - An `ElevatedButton` triggers the API call.
  - Displays a `CircularProgressIndicator` while loading.
  - Shows either the vehicle details, an error message, or a prompt to enter a vehicle number.

- **API Call:**

  Uses the `http` package to make a POST request to the API endpoint with the vehicle number and necessary headers. Handles different response scenarios including successful data retrieval and errors.
